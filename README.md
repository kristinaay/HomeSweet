# Project Objective: 
Develop a web app that allows users to browse through SF housing scraped from Craigslist. Users can then search posts by neighborhood or filter posts by price, as well as save posts and annotate those saved posts. Users can also navigate to the calendar page to make and delete viewing appointments for the houses they plan to visit.
